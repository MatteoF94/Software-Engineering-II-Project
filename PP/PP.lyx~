Purpose and scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document represents the Project Plan Document for Power Enjoy service.
 Planning is a crucial part of the project because a bad estimation can
 lead to a total failure.
 A Project plan gives information about the size of the project, in terms
 of line of code and cost/effort actually required on the base of different
 approaches (Function Points and COCOMO).
 Moreover it studies how to map the different tasks (different parts to
 be developed) on the actual person working at the project.
 In the end a risk analysis is done to face before every possible problem
 that can be discovered during the development.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Definitions and abbreviations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Function Points estimation: is an estimation of the size of a specific software
 in terms of line of codes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SLOC (Source Lines Of Code): it measures the lines of code of a project
 (empty and commented lines excluded).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
FP (function point): is a unit of measurement to express the amount of business
 functionality an information system provides to a user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gannt diagram: a type of bar chart illustrating a project schedule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
4GL: is a computer programming language envisioned as a refinement of the
 style of languages classified as third-generation programming language
 (3GL).
 Languages claimed to be 4GL may include support for database management,
 report generation, mathematical optimization, GUI development, or web developme
nt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gearing factor: it is the average number of new plus modified (Effective)
 Source Lines of Code per function point in the completed project.
 Gearing factors are calculated by dividing the effective code count for
 a completed project by the final function point count.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Internal logic file (ILF): homogeneous set of data used and managed by the
 application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
External interface file (EIF): homogeneous set of data used by the application
 but generated and maintained by other applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
External input (EI): elementary operation to elaborate data coming from
 the external environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
External output (EO): elementary operation that generates data for the external
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
External inquiry (EQ): elementary operation that involves input and output,
 without significant elaboration of data from logic files.

\begin_layout Section
Estimated measurements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various measurement must be considered to provide a clear and detailed view
 of the project.
 Among them in this section we are going to consider size, effort, cost
 and human (and not) resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Function points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Widely accepted as an industry standard for functional sizing, FPs measure
 systems from a functional perspective they are independent from technology.
 Regardless of language, development method, or hardware platform used,
 the number of function points for a system will remain constant.
 The only variable is the amount of effort needed to deliver a given set
 of function points.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The function point counts at the end of requirements and/or designs can
 be compared to function points actually delivered.
 If the project has grown, there has been scope creep.
 The amount of growth is an indication of how well requirements were gathered
 by and/or communicated to the project team.
 If the amount of growth of projects declines over time it is a natural
 assumption that communication with the user has improved.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

FPs can be used to estimate LOC depending on the average number of LOC per
 FP for a given language, considering the following formula:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
LOC=FP*AVC
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Where LOC indicates the lines of code, FP the number of function points
 and AVC a language-dependent factor varying from 200-300 for assembly language
 to 2-40 for a 4GL.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Function points are classified under different types.
 For each type, a different weight is also assigned for each function point
 according if the concerned function is estimated as being simple, complex,
 or average.
 For the estimation of the size of PowerEnJoy the standard weights are indicated
 in the following table:

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Function point analysis is based on 5 user identifiable logical "functions"
 which are divided into 2 data function types and 3 transactional function
 types (table above).
 For a given software application, each of these elements is quantified
 and weighted, counting its characteristic elements, like file references
 or logical fields.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
External Inputs (EIs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application interacts both with users and cars, that are the main actors
 of the system.
 We may also consider as a secondary actor the operators called when an
 accident happens, even though it is not direct part of the system, with
 the exception of an interface.
 Each of them has its own set of possible interactions.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Considering the user, the system has to grant him: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Login / Logout: operation that involves the LoginController component of
 the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Research of nearby cars: this operation takes place when the user is going
 to reserve or monitor a car.
 Before it, the system checks his position, or the suggested one by the
 user, to show him the cars available within.
 This operation has medium complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reservation of a car: after having researched a car and selected it, the
 user is invited to make a reservation, if it is available, or a monitoring.
 In the first case, the request is sent and the system has to check for
 its correctness.
 After that, the user has to be notified that the car that has been reserved,
 or that the request has been rejected.
 This operation , due to use of external elements, as the ones to send or
 receive messages, is complex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Monitoring of a car: after having researched a car and selected it, the
 user is invited to make a reservation, if it is available, or a monitoring.
 In the latter case, the request is sent and the system has check for its
 correctness.
 After that, the user has to be notified that the request on the car has
 been successful, or has been rejected.
 With respect to the reservation process, it's a slightly more complex procedure
, because it also involves the continuous check of the car status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Deletion of a reservation: deleting has an average complexity because all
 the monitoring users on the interested car have to be notified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Deletion of a monitoring: deleting a monitoring has a low complexity, because
 it only involves the deletion of the user in the list of monitoring user
 for a specific car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Request of the access code: when the user has made a reservation and it's
 in time to pick up the car, he/she has to inform the system that he/she
 needs the code to access the car and benefit from the service.
 The complexity is low because the usual checks are made and an unique code
 is generated and stored for that user, until expiration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Registration of a new account: registering implies an average complexity
 because it has to write on the main database new information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Emergency button press: the system has to receive the signal and simply
 contact an external operator, redirecting him/her to the user.
 The complexity is very low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering the car, the system receive the data of the ride and compute
 them, sending back as result the cost of the ride.
 This operation is complex.
 Moreover, there is the retrieval of the car data using the VehicleInterface
 component.
 It is a complex operation because it involves the conversion of data format
 and small elaboration.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Lastly the system includes the action to add, delete or update a safe zone,
 made by the system itself or an operator with particular privileges.
 Each of this action has an high complexity, because it involves the use
 of the database and the update of all the car status (just think about
 the deletion of a safe area in which some cars are parked...).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our application must send information to the mobile phone of the user, to
 the car and to the external operator, outside the inquiries world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Map construction: it refers to the information that the system sends to
 the user mobile phone through the connection when the user searches for
 the available cars within a certain range (including position, real availabilit
y, battery, and so on).
 It is a simple transmission of data, hence the complexity is low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Notification of successful/unsuccessful reservation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Notification of successful/unsuccessful monitoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Notification of ended monitoring (car taken)/available monitored car (car
 reservation taken back or expired): it refers to the notification sent
 when the car monitored becomes available again, using the push gateway,
 or when the car has been picked up, and all the users monitoring it are
 deleted from the list and informed.
 It has medium complexity, due to the logic involved in the elimination
 and coherence with the database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Notification of the cost of the ride with the applied bonuses/overcharges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Car updated when certain event occurs, such as end of the ride, code reset,
 automatic lock (imposed by the server).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Notification of the operator: it refers to the connection made possible
 by the system between the user and the operator, with a low complexity.

External Inquiries (EQs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An inquiry is essentially a data retrieval request performed by an actor.
 The external inquiries includes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Request from the user of the positions of the nearby cars, from his/her
 location or from the specified point.
 This is done checking every car positions in the user zone and the user
 positions and considering only the cars included in a certain radius.
 This procedure is very complex, because the distance cannot easily calculated
 with an Euclidean method, too simple, but considering the structure of
 the roads.

\series bold
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Request from the operator of the ride data.
 Even though it is not included in the software, the system shall provide,
 along with the communication interface with the operator, a module that
 allows the retrieval of specific data, useful to understand better the
 situation of an accident.
 It is quite complex because it should provide only little access, for the
 operator, to the content of the server knowledge.

The system class was an extremely simplified representation of all the other
 components that interacts with the model (that is what is represented in
 the diagram of figure 1.
 We have also to include every components and its modules.
 This, however, is a difficult task, because we don't exactly know the number
 of modules of each component.
 For such reason we set the complexity of the system class as maximum, so
 15.

From the table we can see a huge gap between internal logic and all the
 other parts.
 An explanation could be the fact that the client app and the cars mainly
 give data to the system, which is the one that computes them and gives

 The other important part is the external input, because on that relies
 all the computation of the system.
 However it seems overestimated the difference between them.
 To conclude, the aim

In a perfectly symmetrical distribution of gearing factors, the average
 and the median will be identical or very close.
 The average is obtained by summing the gearing factors and then dividing
 by the number of gearing factors included in that sum.
 Although its purpose is to measure "central tendency", the average can
 be pulled up or down by extreme data values (or outliers).
 The median, on the other hand, is simply the data point that lies in the
 center of an ordered list of gearing factors.
 One half of the data points will lie above (and one half below) the median.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To conclude, the median may be a more accurate indicator of the central
 tendency.
 Using J2EE to develop our software, we refer to particular values of gearing
 factors.

The sequence of tasks involving this project are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Preparation of the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document, containing
 the goals, the domain assumptions, and the functional and nonfunctional
 requirements of the project.
 There is a fixed deadline for the RASD delivery (blue in the graph).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Preparation of the Design Document, containing the architecture and the
 design of the project.
 There is a fixed deadline for the DD delivery (blue in the graph).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Preparation of the Integration Testing Plan Document, containing the strategy
 used to perform integration testing on the system.
 There is a fixed deadline for the ITPD (blue in the graph).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Preparation of the Project Plan, which is this document.
 There is a fixed deadline for the PP (blue in the graph).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Presentation of a brief explanation (∼ 30 min) about the delivered documents,
 with slides, in a fixed day (6 February).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implementation of the software system (coding) and write unit tests.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Perform integration testing on the software developed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the points are not strictly fixed, but can be iterated multiple times,
 as new requirements emerge, new choices are made.
 In particular, unit and integration testing will be continuously performed
 throughout the development process.
 Note also that some tasks need to be concluded before some other can begin,
 as the code implementation cannot happen before the design of the software,
 or the integration testing cannot happen before the code is implemented
 and the integration plan is made.

The last two parts of the schedule, that are the code implementation and
 the integration testing have not a real deadline.
 However, using the previously calculated data about the estimated duration
 of the project, we can use the average duration, so that the whole project
 will last for about 10 month, so from October 2016 to August 2017.
 We also fixed a

Resource allocation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we are going to map the different tasks on the team working
 at the project (us).
 Our team is composed of two persons, so we have theoretically split every
 part of the project in two.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

However, during working process, it happens that the working time will not
 be the same because of common daily issues.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

As we said previously, we considered a full project development to represent
 a more realistic estimation, that won't be really done (implementation
 and testing).
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Almost every task involves the contribution of each member.
 This allows a more efficient and secure control over the work of the team
 members, due to the fact that there is more communication and possible
 incoherence or misunderstandings are avoided.
 Obviously each task can be further broken into smaller sub tasks, respectively
 representing the actual work done on the project.
 Since until now every deadline has been respected, the division of the
 work load coincides with what has been done for the delivery of the project
 documents, including this.
 For further information related to such division, all the documents can
 be consulted, checking the changelog and the hours of work section, at
 their end.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Figure 4 represents an high level allocation of the resources, considering
 small chunk of work, grouped by main task (that are the main documents
 and the real implementation).

Risk Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we are going to discuss some of the risks, that can be technical
 or economical, that the project could face during its development.
 Obviously not every single risk will be considered because it's impossible
 to predict what will really happen, hence what follows will represent a
 simple estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Delays
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider the team of the project : a programmer is supposed to be
 skilled and working 8 hours a day.
 This estimation fails when the programmer gets ill or quits.
 A solution to this risk could be splitting the task between more programmers,
 so that when one of them gets ill, the others are able to work as well.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is not the best approach because it can lead to an increase of time
 of work, due to the preparation of new personnel.
 However, if a person quits, the project doesn't fail and can be finished
 by someone else.
 Lastly, even a bad estimation of the required time for each task can lead
 to a delay in the delivery of such task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of communication among the team
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those kind of difficulties can be overcome by explicitly defining the responsibi
lities and tasks to be done by each team member, and by writing clear and
 complete specification and design documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lack of experience in programming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The team has no concrete experience in programming using Java EE.
 This will require more time during the coding phase, slowing the development
 phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Requirements change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The requirements may change during the development in unexpected way.
 This risk can’t be prevented, but can be mitigated by writing reusable
 and extensible software.

\begin_layout Subsection
Technical risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data loss
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data can be lost due to various reasons, such as hardware failures or wrong
 usage of merging tools.
 This problem is easily avoided enforcing a periodic backup plan.
 Backups should be kept into a separate device from the main storage one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hardware failure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cars should have a proper setup in order to work, especially hardware.
 The most critical factor is given by the VehicleInterface component, that
 has both software and hardware components.
 More attention is then required to avoid possible problems related to the
 car piece of project implementation, thus more work time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integration testing failure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some components and subsystems may not pass the integration testing phase:
 this can require to rewrite large pieces of software.
 This risk can be reduced by defining precisely the interfaces between component
s and subsystems, and by doing integration tests early using stubs and drivers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Downtime / unavailability of service
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system could go down for excessive load, software bugs, power outages
 or connection services faults.
 While the first two can be mitigated with a specific test on the hardware
 and software composing our system, the latter ones are unavoidable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Incremental code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being the basic structure monolithic, there is a good chance that the growth
 of the code may lead to an unreadable and messy agglomerate of modules
 and, in the worst case, to difficult understanding of the whole code.
 This can be avoided making the project extremely modularized, improving
 the quality of the Design Document before the code implementation phase.
 Moreover, code inspection can be done periodically.
 The adopted language helps us in giving a defined structure to our system.

Economical risks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bankruptcy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The income from the sales of the software may not be enough to sustain the
 development, maintenance and deployment of the software system.
 A good feasibility study helps to avoid this situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Competitors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other companies can build equivalent or better products at a lower price
 and put PowerEnJoy out of use.
 This may not be very probable, because important components are self-made
 and so unique for our system, like the VehicleInterface.
 Car sharing is not a new business, so it is important to focus on improving
 some aspects of the service, to have a competitive advantage compared to
 the other sharing services.

Some of the client requests may have not been accomplished or satisfied
 (like features not included or UIs not very friendly), leading to a loss
 of time to better improve the software, or even the future loss of the

Apart from the initial period, gaining popularity is the key to back up

 Once the project is presented, it is important to start collecting possible
 future users.
 Otherwise the risk of not being supported may lead to a failure.
 Hence it is important to properly advertize the app.
