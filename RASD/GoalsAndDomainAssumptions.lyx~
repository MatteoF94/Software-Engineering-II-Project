Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G1] Ensures that only the account owner can access his/her own account,
 if he/she is already registered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G2] Allows the user to reserve an available car for up to one hour before
 the service starts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G3] Allows the user to take back his/her reservation for an available car
 before the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

picking up time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 expires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G4] Allows the user to monitor the status of the available cars within
 an area that he/she specified, or in the nearby areas, for a possible reservati
on.
 If the car has a low battery charge, such as less than 20%, it does not
 appear on the user interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G5] Ensures that the user is able to trace/check the status of a car, available
 or already reserved, and receive push notification about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G6] Ensures that the user is able to access, and open, the car he/she reserved,
 if he/she is in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G7] Ensures that the service, and the carghing on the user, starts only
 when the engine of a car is ignited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G7] Ensures that the user is informed real-time on the current cost of
 the service, when using it, and the possible discounts and overcharges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G8] Allows the user to stop the car for a brief moment to rest or to pick
 up / leave passengers.
 He/she will however still be charged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G9] Ensures that the user knows the safe area around him/her.
 is informed by the car internal system of the safe-areas around him/her,
 within a specified range (like a mini-map).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G10] Allows the user to press a button on the car to contact an operator
 in case of emergency, such as a car accident, a mechanical problem or sudden
 ilness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G11] Ensures that the user receive a discount or overcharge when specific
 conditions are met.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G12] Ensures that when the user leaves the car and closes the door, the
 service ends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G13] Ensures that when the user picks up a car, it has no mechanical or
 electrical problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Specification about goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G5] derives from the idea that multiple users may want to use tha same
 available car.
 Only one is able to make a reservation, but the others may be interested
 to check if the car is effectively taken by the reserving user.
 It could happen that he/she takes back the reservation or simply doesn't
 pick up the car within the reservation time.
 In such case, the car would be available once again and all the interested
 users will receive a notification about it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G9] is one of the functional goals that provides the user a reliable way
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

help
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the service to work correctely.
 Being notified of the nearby zones to park, it will be unlikely for him/her
 to abandon the car midway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[G11] refers to the particular condition expressed in the project description.
 If the user takes on two ore more passengers, he/she receives a discount
 of 10% on the cost of the ride.
 If the user leaves the car with more than 50% of the battery available,
 a discount of 20% is applied.
 If the user plugs in the car before ending the service, the applied discount
 is 30% over the total.
 However, if the user leaves the car 3 km far from a safe area or with less
 than 20% of the battery available, he/she is overcharged of 30% of the
 cost of the ride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Domain assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All the GPS localisation services have no fault and always returns the correct
 position of a device (car, phone, tablet...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If a car is locked, nobody can access it.
 However, technicians are able to use a code to operate on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The databases on which the system relies on works without problems (no data
 loss, no incoherence).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once a user is registered, the system won't accept any other registration
 with his/her data.
 In other words, a user can register only once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once a user is registered, his/her information will be saved and present
 in the system database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All the notifications that a user can receive from his/her account are immediate
 and always working.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All the updates of the status of a car are immediate and correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A user will never leave the car in a zone unreachable by GPS localisation
 or too far from the nearest safe-area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A user will never leave the car with a door open, and neither the passengers
 will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Users will encounter no problems when accessing the car using a code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When registering, users will insert only Credit Card info or Debit Card
 info as methods of payment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Technicians and operators are always available and provided by a third party
 agent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Passwords and codes are unique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discounts and overcharges are always calculated and applied in the correct
 way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Technicians and other services (police, ambulances, firetrucks) will reach
 the location addressed by the user/operator in the shortest possible time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every car is able to detect it a mechanical/electrical problem occurs, and
 modify its status.
