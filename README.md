# Software-Engineering-II-Project
Repository containing the assigned project of Software Engineering II.  
__PowerEnJoy__ is an electrical car sharing service, based on a mobile application. The targets of the service, intended as users,
are people that needs to move from a place to another within a city and requires a conveyance to move (because they don't have
their own or simply can't use it).
The project consists in the writing of four documents:  
1) Requirement analysis and specifications document, __RASD__: contains the description of the scenarios, the use cases that describe them,
and the models describing requirements and specification for the problem under consideration.  
2) Design document, __DD__: contain a functional description of the system.  
3) Integration Test Plan Document, __ITPD__: aims at describing how to accomplish the integration test.  
4) Project Plan, __PP__: aims at defining a planning for the project.  
For further information about the assignment and the documents, you can check the __"Assignments AA 2016-2017.pdf"__ document in the
__CommonRefDocs__ folder.  

__Each document has its own folder__, characterized by the same name (so the RASD documents are contained in the RASD folder, and so on).  
The __Releases__ folder contains the most recent version of the documents that are finished, while you can check the unfinished document in
their respective folder. This is the most important folder because it contains all the documents you may be interested in.  
If you are particularly curious, there is also the __OldReleases__ folder, that contains all the document versions after the delivery date,
with an exception for the most recent ones.  
In the __CodeFragments__ folder you can find some simple fragments of stand alone code, concerning algorithms and tests to prove their correct functionality.  
The __PowerEnJoy.mdj__ file is a collection of UML diagrams, made with StarUML. You can find each diagram as an image in the dedicated document.  
Lastly, the __Presentation__ folder contains all the presentation related for each document, to help describing and showing them to a
possible audience.  

That's all you need to know to understand how to move inside the folders and check the project state. __EnJoy!__
