\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document, addressed mainly to developers, aims to go into further details
 regarding the specification of the project, described in the RASD.
 Here more technical features will be described, including:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The high level architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some possible design patterns 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The description of the main components and their interaction (Runtime View)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A brief description of the algorithms on which the software relies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A more detailed overview of the user interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although these are the main topics of the document, other minor details
 will be touched and discussed, such as the architectural style and a brief
 comparison with other styles and the mapping between the requirements defined
 in the RASD and the designed elements described in this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PowerEnJoy is an electrical car sharing service, based on a mobile application.
 The targets of the service, intended as users, are people that needs to
 move from a place to another within a city and requires a conveyance to
 move (because they don't have their own or simply can't use it).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A user can make a reservation for a car, using the mobile app and his/her
 account, and check for the availability and status of all the cars within
 his/her position, identified using GPS localization, or a specific one,
 inserted manually by the user.
 As stated before, to access the service, the user must possess a private
 account, so a registration is needed.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The system provides the users a safe way (identification code) to access
 the cars, and the riding service and keeps trace of the status of all the
 cars.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Moreover, the system prizes or punishes a respectively good or bad behavior
 from the users, applying a discount or an overcharge on the cost of a ride.
 As example, if the user leaves the car without much battery, he/she will
 have to pay more than the standard cost of the ride, because the car will
 need to be charged and this operation has a cost.
 On the other hand, if a user plugs the car before ending the service, it
 receives a discount.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The system includes other functionality, such as GPS based maps available
 in every car, an emergency procedure in case an accident occur during a
 ride and the notification of a car status if the user requested it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RASD: document about the requirements analysis of the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
DD: document about the design choices and the components description of
 the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the Earth where
 there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SMS: short message service; it is a notification sent to a mobile phone,
 we need a GSM gateway to use it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GMS gateway: device that allows SMS text messages to be sent and/or received
 by email, from Web pages or from other software applications by acquiring
 a unique identifier from the mobile phone's Subscriber Identity Module,
 or SIM card.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Push notification/ push message: it is a notification sent to a smartphone
 using the mobile application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
API: application programming interface; it is a common way to communicate
 with another system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
REST: representational state transfer, it's one way of providing interoperabilit
y between computer systems on the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RESTFul: REST with no session.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UX: user experience design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
BCE: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
URL: uniform resource locator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MVC: model view controller, it's a design pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SOA: service oriented architecture, it's a style of software design where
 services are provided to the other components by application components,
 through a communication protocol over a network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Layer: way of organizing code in sections sharing a common goal.
 The highest partition includes Presentation Layer, Business or Logic Layer
 and Data Layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tier: physical deployment of layers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Safe area: it is a specific area where the electric cars of PowerEnJoy service
 can park.
 The set of safe areas is pre-defined and owned by the company/society that
 requested the management system for the service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Special safe area: it is a safe area where power grid stations are installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Power grid station: it is an installation that allows the recharge of an
 electric car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Communication primitives: set of instructions and procedure that allow a
 communication between machines and devices over a network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sensor data retrieval: procedure that consists in getting all the information
 collected by the sensors of the car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Document structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Introduction: this section introduces the design document.
 It gives an overview on what topics will be covered and what aspects described
 in the RASD will be improved here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Architecture Design: this section is divided into different parts, each
 describing an aspect of the software design.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Overview: brief description of the division in tiers and layers of the applicati
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
High level components and interaction: high level view of the components
 of the application and the way they communicate.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Algorithm Design: this section describes some of the algorithms that the
 application will rely on.
 To focus on the algorithm idea and not the fine grained implementation,
 pseudo-code will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User Interface Design: this section presents mockups and user experience
 explained via UX and BCE diagrams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Requirements Traceability: this section aims to explain how the decisions
 taken in the RASD are linked to design elements.
